# Trading DB Quickstart

Ethereum blockchain providers expose a common interface for querying, but to query blockchain providers directly for tournament-related info would be much too slow. That's why we've developed [pm-trading-db](https://github.com/gnosis/pm-trading-db), which syncs up with and queries a blockchain provider directly, filtering related data into an indexed database which provides great boosts in speed when querying the database.

## Tournament Setup

### Deploy your contracts
To configure a custom tournament, you need first to [deploy the smart contracts needed on the chosen public network](smart-contracts.md). For this setup guide, we will assume the choice of [Rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io/#stats).

Take note of your deployed addresses for [AddressRegistry](https://github.com/gnosis/pm-apollo-contracts#addressregistry) and the [PlayToken](https://github.com/gnosis/pm-apollo-contracts#playtoken). You can find them with `npm run truffle networks`. This guide will assume the following as the deployed addresses, though you will have something different:

```
OlympiaToken: 0x2924e2338356c912634a513150e6ff5be890f7a0
AddressRegistry: 0x12f73864dc1f603b2e62a36b210c294fd286f9fc
```

### Run ethereum node
You may have a running Geth node connected to [Rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io/#geth) on the same machine:

```sh
geth --rinkeby --rpc
```

If you don't want to have your own node you can use Infura's, but it will be slower than using a local node.

### Configure pm-trading-db
Clone the `pm-trading-db` repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gnosis/pm-trading-db.git
cd pm-trading-db
```

Change these lines with the previous values in **.env_rinkeby**:

```sh
TOURNAMENT_TOKEN=0x2924e2338356c912634a513150e6ff5be890f7a0
GENERIC_IDENTITY_MANAGER_ADDRESS=0x12f73864dc1f603b2e62a36b210c294fd286f9fc
```

Add your ethereum account too for **token issuance** in **.env**. You will need some **ether** on it for gas costs:

```sh
ETHEREUM_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=0x847968C6407F32eb261dC19c3C558C445931C9fF
ETHEREUM_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=a3b12a165350ab3c7d1ecd3596096969db2839c7899a3b0b39dd479fdd5148c7
```

If you don't have the private key for your account, but you do know the [BIP39](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) mnemonic for it, you may enter your mnemonic into [Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache) to recover the private key. You can omit the `ETHEREUM_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` if you have the **address unlocked** in your Ethereum node.

Configure the HTTP provider on **.env** and change `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.local` to `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.rinkeby`:

```
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.rinkeby
ETHEREUM_NODE_URL=http://172.17.0.1:8545
```

We wrote **172.17.0.1** because that's usually the IP of the **docker host**, and **geth** is running in your machine, not in docker.

Then in **pm-trading-db root folder**:

### Run pm-trading-db in Docker
```
docker-compose build --force-rm
docker-compose run web sh
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py setup_tournament --start-block-number 2000000
exit
docker-compose up
```

The command `setup_tournament` will prepare the database and set up periodic tasks:
  - `--start-block-number` will, if specified, start pm-trading-db processing at a specific block instead of all the way back at the genesis block. You should provide the latest block before tournament events start occurring as you can. We don't actually have to start syncing the database until the first block in which a contract we are considering has been deployed. Let's take [BigToken](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xd3515609e3231d6c5b049a28d0d09d038b4cfaed) for example again. Its [contract creation transaction](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0xaa10a3d8ba2a08ae277eaadd5b876753ac118ede542ae89c25c882eda3766c53) occurred at a block height of [2105737](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/block/2105737). This means the `setup_tournament` command could be invoked like this:
    ```sh
    python manage.py setup_tournament --start-block-number 2105737
    ```
  - **Ethereum blockchain event receiver** every 5 seconds (the main task of the application).
  - **Scoreboard calculation** every 10 minutes.
  - **Token issuance** every minute. Tokens will be issued in batches of 50 users (to prevent
  exceeding the block limitation). A flag will be set to prevent users from being issued again on next
  execution of the task.
  - **Token issuance flag clear**. Once a day the token issuance flag will be cleared so users will
  receive new tokens every day.

### Final steps
All these tasks can be changed in the [application admin](http://localhost:8000/admin/django_celery_beat/periodictask/).
You will need a superuser:

```
docker-compose run web sh
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You should have now the api running in http://localhost:8000. You have to be patient because the
first synchronization of Rinkeby may take some time, depending on how many blocks pm-trading-db has to process. It may take even more time if your Geth node is unsynchronized, since it [may need to finish synchronizing](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/14338) before it will have the information required.

At this point you should have a `geth --rinkeby` node running alongside an instance of **pm-trading-db**.

## Custom event receivers

### Implement Python event receiver
With custom event receivers you will be able to listen for events on your own contracts. Custom event receivers can be set up in **pm-trading-db** extending `django_eth_events.chainevents.AbstractEventReceiver` and then defining methods:
  - `save(decoded_event, block_info)`: Will process events when received. `block_info` will have the [web3 block structure](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.eth.html#web3.eth.Eth.getBlock) of the ethereum block where the event is found.
  - `rollback(decoded_event, block_info)`: Will process events in case of reorg. The event will be the same that in `save`, so you decide how to rollback the changes (in case that's needed).

Every `decoded_event` has `address` and `name`, and then decoded params under `params` key. `address` is always lowercase without `0x`. Example of event:
```js
{
    "address": "b3289eaac0fe3ed15df177f925c6f8ceeb908b8f",
    "name": "CentralizedOracleCreation",
    "params": [
        {
            "name": "creator",
            "value": "67ed2c5c09b7aa308dbd0fb8754b695e5bb030ad"
        },
        {
            "name": "centralizedOracle",
            "value": "88c2c1bb33c4939f58384629e7b5f26d90bafcc9"
        },
        {
            "name": "ipfsHash",
            "value": "QmNUhQD2hzRb8Pj31RHtBaJNpZUzQ9cg1AKKW8SFVScFb5"
        }
    ]
}
```

You can add a custom **EventReceiver** to the event receivers file **tradingdb/chainevents/event_receivers.py**. An example of EventReceiver:
```python
from django_eth_events.chainevents import AbstractEventReceiver

class TestEventReceiver(AbstractEventReceiver):
    def save(self, decoded_event, block_info=None):
        event_name = decoded_event.get('name')
        address = decoded_event.get('address')

        print('Received event', event_name, 'with address', address)
        print(decoded_event.get('params'))

    def rollback(self, decoded_event, block_info=None):
        # Undo stuff done by `save` in case of reorg
        # For example, delete a database object created on `save`
        # No need for rollback in this case
        pass
```

### Add contract ABI
If you want to listen events for your **own contract**, you need to add the **json ABI** to **tradingdb/chainevents/abis/** folder to make pm-trading-db capable of decoding the events.

Then you need to configure your receiver before starting **pm-tradingdb** for the first time. Go to **config/settings/olympia.py** and add your event receiver as a Python dictionary. Required fields are:
  - **ADDRESSES**: List addresses of the contracts to be watched for events. If you need to watch one single address, use a one element list.
  - **EVENT_ABI**: ABI of your custom contract (used to decode the events).
  - **EVENT_DATA_RECEIVER**: Absolute python import path for the custom event receiver class.
  - **NAME**: Name of the receiver, just don't use same name that another receiver.


### Configure custom event receiver

Example of a custom event receiver:
```js
{
    'ADDRESSES': ['0xD6fF69322719b077fDC5335535989Aa702016276', '0x992575d97fa3C31f39a81BDC3D517aE7D8C1C5A2'],
    'EVENT_ABI': load_json_file(abi_file_path('MyTestContract.json')),
    'EVENT_DATA_RECEIVER': 'chainevents.event_receivers.TournamentTokenReceiver',
    'NAME': 'OlympiaToken',
},
```

You should now be ready to run **pm-trading-db**
