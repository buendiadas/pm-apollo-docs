# GnosisDB

Ethereum blockchain providers expose a common interface for querying, but to query blockchain providers directly for tournament-related info would be much too slow. That's why we've developed [GnosisDB](https://github.com/gnosis/gnosisdb), which syncs up with and queries a blockchain provider directly, filtering related data into an indexed database which provides great boosts in speed when querying the database.

Follow the GnosisDB [**Tournament Setup** instructions](https://github.com/gnosis/gnosisdb#tournament-setup). You will have a `geth --rinkeby` node running alongside an instance of GnosisDB.

To cut down on the sync time, note that we don't actually have to start syncing the database until the first block in which a contract we are considering has been deployed. Let's take [BigToken](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xd3515609e3231d6c5b049a28d0d09d038b4cfaed) for example again. Its [contract creation transaction](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0xaa10a3d8ba2a08ae277eaadd5b876753ac118ede542ae89c25c882eda3766c53) occurred at a block height of [2105737](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/block/2105737). This means the `setup_tournament` command could be invoked like this:

```sh
python manage.py setup_tournament --start-block-number 2105737
```
