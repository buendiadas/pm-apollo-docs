# GnosisDB

Ethereum blockchain providers expose a common interface for querying, but to query blockchain providers directly for tournament-related info would be much too slow. That's why we've developed [GnosisDB](https://github.com/gnosis/gnosisdb), which syncs up with and queries a blockchain provider directly, filtering related data into an indexed database which provides great boosts in speed when querying the database.

Follow the GnosisDB [**Tournament Setup** instructions](https://github.com/gnosis/gnosisdb#tournament-setup). You will have an instance of GnosisDB set up.
