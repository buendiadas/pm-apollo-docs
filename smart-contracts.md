# Smart Contracts

In order to run a fresh tournament, you will need to deploy a set of contracts for the tournament. These contracts can be found at the [`pm-apollo-contracts` repository](https://github.com/gnosis/pm-apollo-contracts), or on NPM as `@gnosis.pm/pm-apollo-contracts`.

You may also wish to configure some parameters for your deployment, or even to modify some things. We will create a new package for these purposes. We will be using NPM for this guide, though it will probably work with EthPM if you adapt it appropriately.

## Unbox a `lil-box`

Let's say that we want to name the tournament play token "Big Token." We want to be able to work with this token in Gnosis JS and ultimately in the user interface to the tournament. Let's make and enter a directory called `big-token`, where we will prepare a package:

```sh
mkdir big-token
cd big-token
```

We will unbox a Truffle box called [lil-box](https://github.com/gnosis/lil-box) here:

```sh
truffle unbox gnosis/lil-box
```

## Initialize Git and NPM

Make a Git repo here if desired:

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

You may create a repo on Github if desired:

![Repo creation screen](assets/make-github.png)

```sh
git remote add origin git@github.com:cag/big-token.git
git push -u origin master
```

Then let's complete the [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) `package.json` setup:

```
$ npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
package name: (big-token) 
...
```

## Specify the Contracts

Install `@gnosis.pm/pm-apollo-contracts` as a dependency:

```sh
npm i @gnosis.pm/pm-apollo-contracts
```

Then create a contract in `contracts/` called `BigToken.sol` (you are free to name this as you wish):

```sol
pragma solidity ^0.4.21;

import "@gnosis.pm/pm-apollo-contracts/contracts/PlayToken.sol";

contract BigToken is PlayToken {
    string public constant name = "Big Token";
    string public constant symbol = "BIG";
    uint8 public constant decimals = 18;
}

import "@gnosis.pm/pm-apollo-contracts/contracts/AddressRegistry.sol";
```

In our example, we are keeping the functionality of the [PlayToken](https://github.com/gnosis/pm-apollo-contracts) the same, but you are free to modify the token however you'd like. Also note that we set the `name`, `symbol` and `decimal` fields which are optional [ERC20](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) fields, but also highly recommended for correct interoperability with the frontend. Finally, make sure to set the `decimal` field to 18, matching the format of ether.

We also import the [AddressRegistry](https://github.com/gnosis/pm-apollo-contracts) so that we can deploy our own copy of that registry for our users.

## Do a Compilation Test

Try compiling the contract:

```
$ npm run truffle compile

> big-token@2.0.0 truffle /path/to/big-token
> truffle "compile"

Compiling ./contracts/BigToken.sol...

[Some more stuff...]

Writing artifacts to ./build/contracts
```

## Create Migration Scripts

We have two build artifacts in `./build/contracts` in which we are currently interested: `BigToken.json` and `AddressRegistry.json`. We need the contracts these correspond with to be deployed, and we need these artifacts to contain that deployment information. First, we create a migration script to deploy these contracts in the `migrations` folder as `2_deploy_contracts.js`:

```js
module.exports = function(deployer) {
  ["BigToken", "AddressRegistry"].forEach(c =>
    deployer.deploy(artifacts.require(c))
  );
};
```

This will cause Truffle to deploy these contracts as part of its migration process. Try this deployment out in the Truffle development environment:

```
$ npm run truffle develop

[Truffle does some setup and opens a command line. You will want to run 'migrate' in the shell:]

truffle(develop)> migrate
Using network 'develop'.

truffle(develop)> 
```

If you've done this before, `migrate` might fail. In that case, try `migrate --reset` instead. Also, after running that command, you can see that there is deployment information about the test migration recorded in the artifacts:

```
$ npm run truffle networks

> big-token@2.0.0 truffle /path/to/big-token
> truffle "networks"


Network: UNKNOWN (id: 4447)
  AddressRegistry: 0xf25186b5081ff5ce73482ad761db0eb0d25abfbf
  BigToken: 0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10
  Migrations: 0x8cdaf0cd259887258bc13a92c0a6da92698644c0
```

If that worked, we're ready to deploy this on a public test network.

## Deploy Contracts on the Testnet

For the purpose of this guide, let's suppose that we wish to deploy the contracts on [Rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io/#stats).

[With that in mind, follow this deployment guide](https://gnosis.github.io/lil-box/deployment-guide.html) and run the migration process on the Rinkeby testnet.

Make sure that the network information has been extracted into `networks.json` via `npm run extractnetinfo`. Also, make sure that the build artifacts contain only the information necessary via `npm run resetnetinfo`. You can check the information in the build artifacts via `npm run truffle networks`:

```
> truffle "networks"


Network: rinkeby (id: 4)
  AddressRegistry: 0xd3515609e3231d6c5b049a28d0d09d038b4cfaed
  BigToken: 0x0152b7ed5a169e0292525fb2bf67ef1274010c74
  Migrations: 0xf0681a06da32b8276b0a7b685019056c2bcfbf13
```

## Prepare Package Entry Point

By default, `index.js` is set as the entry point of the package. We will export the most pertinent build artifacts in this entry point:

```js
module.exports = {
  AddressRegistry: require("./build/contracts/AddressRegistry.json"),
  BigToken: require("./build/contracts/BigToken.json")
};
```

Let's verify that this works by attempting to import this in a Node shell:

```
$ node
> require('.')
{ AddressRegistry: 

  [lots of stuff here...] }
> 
```

## Extra Scripts

Let's add a few scripts to the `package.json`:

```json
    "issue-tokens": "truffle exec './node_modules/@gnosis.pm/pm-apollo-contracts/scripts/issue_tokens.js' --play-token-name=BigToken",
    "add-admins": "truffle exec './node_modules/@gnosis.pm/pm-apollo-contracts/scripts/add_admins.js' --play-token-name=BigToken",
    "remove-admins": "truffle exec './node_modules/@gnosis.pm/pm-apollo-contracts/scripts/remove_admins.js' --play-token-name=BigToken",
    "allow-transfers": "truffle exec './node_modules/@gnosis.pm/pm-apollo-contracts/scripts/allow_transfers.js' --play-token-name=BigToken",
    "disallow-transfers": "truffle exec './node_modules/@gnosis.pm/pm-apollo-contracts/scripts/disallow_transfers.js' --play-token-name=BigToken"
```

These will let us issue BigToken, designate admins, and whitelist market and event contracts. See [here](https://github.com/gnosis/pm-apollo-contracts#operations-overview) for more details. For example, the following issues 100 SYM (the symbol for BigToken) to the address 0x873faa4cddd5b157e8e5a57e7a5479afc5d30f0b:

```
npm run issue-tokens -- --network rinkeby issue-tokens --amount 100e18 --to 0x873faa4cddd5b157e8e5a57e7a5479afc5d30f0b
```

## Ship it!

Our package should be ready now! Before we ship it, let's do `npm pack` to see what will get published. You will see the `prepack` script run, and then a tarball named `[name]-[version].tgz` will be created. Let's verify the contents of what we will be publishing:

```
$ tar -tf big-token-2.0.0.tgz

package/.eslintrc.js
package/.prettierignore
package/.travis.yml
package/index.js

If everything looks good, let's publish it!

```text
